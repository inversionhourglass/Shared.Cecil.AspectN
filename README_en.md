## How to Submit an Issue

Since this project is a .NET Shared Project, it doesn't have a corresponding NuGet package. Other projects reference AspectN through submodules. To minimize unnecessary files during reference, the test and demo projects for AspectN are stored separately in [AspectN.Tests](https://github.com/inversionhourglass/AspectN.Tests). Therefore, issues should also be submitted in the [AspectN.Tests](https://github.com/inversionhourglass/AspectN.Tests) repository. Please go to [AspectN.Tests ISSUE](https://github.com/inversionhourglass/AspectN.Tests/issues) to submit an issue.

## How to Use

For usage documentation, please refer to the [Rougamo wiki](). A new version of the documentation will be written and added to the current readme in the future.
