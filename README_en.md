## How to Submit an Issue

Since this project is a .NET Shared Project, it doesn't have a corresponding NuGet package. Other projects reference AspectN through submodules. To minimize unnecessary files during reference, the test and demo projects for AspectN are stored separately in [AspectN.Tests](https://github.com/inversionhourglass/AspectN.Tests).

## How to Use

For usage documentation, please refer to the [Rougamo wiki](https://github.com/inversionhourglass/Rougamo/wiki/%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E5%8C%B9%E9%85%8D#%E7%B1%BBaspectj%E8%A1%A8%E8%BE%BE%E5%BC%8F%E5%8C%B9%E9%85%8D). A new version of the documentation will be written and added to the current readme in the future.
